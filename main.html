		<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
		<p>The Time Complexity of a piece code refers to the order of time it would take for the code to be processed. Time complexity indicates how efficient a piece of code is.</p>
		<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of a piece of code refers to the order of auxiliary space required for the code to be process. For example, O(n) space complexity indicates that the code required a space linearly proportial to <i>n</i>, the number of (variable) elements to be processed.</p>
